# Test Status Summary

The initial test run without mocking produced failures in the E2E workflow suite. Attempts to reach
Google and Microsoft APIs were blocked in the execution environment, so every live step returned a
`failed` status. Below is a perâ€‘test summary of the observed behaviour before enabling mock mode.

Enabling mock mode causes these steps to short-circuit and return deterministic
`complete`/`reverted` statuses so the E2E suite passes consistently.
