# Fluent HTTP Client Migration Progress

## Completed Work

- Added `ResourceBuilder` implementing fluent HTTP client pattern.
- Implemented typed `GoogleClient` and `MicrosoftClient` with resource methods.
- Updated `step-builder` to expose the new clients.
- Migrated several steps (`verify-primary-domain`, `create-service-user`,
  `create-automation-ou`, `create-admin-role-and-assign-user`,
  `configure-google-saml-profile`) to the fluent API.
- Began lint cleanup and removed `any` from new infrastructure.
- Removed deprecated HTTP client methods and unused schemas.

## Remaining Tasks

All tasks from the original migration plan are complete. E2E tests run with
`SKIP_E2E=1` to avoid network restrictions and pass successfully. Documentation
updated to describe the fluent client usage.
