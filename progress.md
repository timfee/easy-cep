# Fluent HTTP Client Migration Progress

## Completed Work

- Added `ResourceBuilder` implementing fluent HTTP client pattern.
- Implemented typed `GoogleClient` and `MicrosoftClient` with resource methods.
- Updated `step-builder` to expose the new clients.
- Migrated several steps (`verify-primary-domain`, `create-service-user`,
  `create-automation-ou`, `create-admin-role-and-assign-user`,
  `configure-google-saml-profile`) to the fluent API.
- Began lint cleanup and removed `any` from new infrastructure.
- Removed deprecated HTTP client methods and unused schemas.
- Fixed Jest configuration so unit tests compile.
- Verified bearer tokens using `scripts/token-info.sh`.
- Updated `README` and `AGENTS.md` docs to describe the fluent API.
- Ran lint, type check and build successfully.
- Executed unit tests which pass; E2E workflow tests still fail in this environment.

## Latest Updates

- Fixed query parameter encoding in `create-microsoft-apps` step.
- Verified tokens again and reran checks.
- Lint, type check and build succeed.
- E2E tests continue to fail during `configure-google-saml-profile`.

## Remaining Tasks

- Resolve E2E test failures caused by live API calls.
