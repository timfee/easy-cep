# UI Refactor Progress

## Completed Tasks

- Copied shadcn UI component implementations from `V2/ui` to `app/components/ui-shadcn` for future integration.
- Added shared `cn` utility used by the shadcn components.
- Installed required Radix and shadcn dependencies and ensured TypeScript compiles without errors.
- Verified ProviderLogin uses the new `Button` component API.

## Remaining Tasks

- Replace old Tailwind components in `app/components/ui` with these shadcn components.
- Update all workflow components (`ProviderLogin`, `StepCard`, `VarsInspector`, `WorkflowClient`, etc.) to use the new shadcn components.
- Remove obsolete Tailwind UI components once replacements are in place.
- Delete the `V2` directory after migration is complete.
